            <h3>Dear Sis,</h3>
            <p>
              Being your sister is the most incredible blessing life has offered me. There is no one I would’ve somewhat grown up and shared experience with, and I 
              promise you will always have me no matter what happens. As your sister, I wish you would learn from my mistakes, and try to get rid of the mistakes i 
              made.. Please never settle for something you don’t want, you have the most beautiful soul and deserve nothing but the absolute best.
              I hope you will always stay true to yourself and your plans. You are my sister, but treating me like a mother in all times.
              </p>
